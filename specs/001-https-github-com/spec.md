- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: How should the ChatKit interface integrate with the existing VRP Assistant? ‚Üí A: Replace the existing VRP Assistant entirely with ChatKit
- Q: Should the chat be able to modify VRP data directly, or only provide analysis and suggestions? ‚Üí A: Read-only analysis - chat can only analyze and suggest, user must manually edit JSON (connects to Agent Builder)
- Q: What VRP analysis capabilities should the chat provide? ‚Üí A: Full analysis suite - Q&A, optimization recommendations, scenario comparison, constraint debugging, what-if analysis, and solution validation
- Q: Should chat sessions persist across browser sessions? ‚Üí A: Browser session only - persist until browser/tab closes
- Q: What level of VRP domain expertise should the chat assume for explanations? ‚Üí A: Expert-level - assume deep VRP expertise, use technical terminology

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A VRP user working with routing problems in the VRP API Explorer needs to analyze and understand their VRP data, solutions, and optimization results through natural language conversation. They want to ask questions like "Why is vehicle 2 taking this route?" or "How can I reduce total distance?" and receive contextual AI-powered insights about their specific VRP problem.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has loaded a VRP problem with vehicles and jobs, **When** they open the chat interface and ask "What's the total distance for all routes?", **Then** the system provides an accurate answer based on the current VRP solution data.

2. **Given** a user is viewing a VRP solution on the map, **When** they ask "Why is vehicle 1 visiting location B before location A?", **Then** the system explains the routing decision considering time windows, capacity, and optimization constraints.

3. **Given** a user wants to optimize their VRP problem, **When** they ask "How can I reduce delivery time?", **Then** the system provides actionable suggestions based on the current problem structure (e.g., adjust time windows, add vehicles, modify priorities).

4. **Given** a user has modified their VRP JSON data, **When** they ask "What changed compared to my last solution?", **Then** the system compares the current and previous states and highlights key differences.

5. **Given** a user encounters a validation error, **When** they ask "What's wrong with my VRP data?", **Then** the system explains the error in plain language and suggests corrections.

6. **Given** a user has two different VRP configurations, **When** they ask "Compare this solution with my previous setup", **Then** the system analyzes and highlights key differences in routes, costs, timing, and resource utilization.

7. **Given** a user wants to test a potential change, **When** they ask "What if I add another vehicle with 50 capacity?", **Then** the system provides what-if analysis explaining likely impacts on route distribution and optimization outcomes.

8. **Given** a user's VRP problem has constraint conflicts, **When** they ask "Why can't all jobs be assigned?", **Then** the system debugs constraints and identifies specific conflicts (e.g., time window violations, capacity mismatches, unreachable locations).

9. **Given** a user receives a VRP solution, **When** they ask "Is this solution valid?", **Then** the system validates all constraints, identifies any violations, and confirms feasibility.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user asks a question before loading any VRP data?
- How does the system handle questions unrelated to VRP analysis?
- What occurs when the VRP problem changes while a chat session is active?
- How does the system respond when asked about features not present in the current VRP problem (e.g., asking about time windows when none are defined)?
- What happens if multiple VRP problems are loaded in succession - does chat context reset?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a chat interface where users can ask natural language questions about their VRP problems and solutions.

- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze the current VRP problem data (vehicles, jobs, locations, constraints, time windows) and provide context-aware responses to user queries.

- **FR-003**: System MUST explain VRP solution results including route assignments, visit sequences, timing decisions, and optimization outcomes.

- **FR-004**: System MUST offer actionable optimization suggestions when users ask how to improve their VRP solutions (e.g., reduce distance, minimize vehicles, improve time window compliance).

- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain conversation context throughout a chat session, allowing follow-up questions without requiring users to repeat VRP problem details.

- **FR-006**: System MUST provide error explanations when users ask about VRP validation errors or API failures.

- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain chat session state for the duration of the browser session (until browser/tab closes), but NOT persist chat history to long-term storage across browser restarts.

- **FR-008**: System MUST replace the existing VRP Assistant entirely, providing all VRP analysis and assistance capabilities through the ChatKit interface.

- **FR-009**: System MUST provide comprehensive VRP analysis capabilities including: question answering about VRP data and solutions, optimization recommendations, scenario comparison between different configurations, constraint debugging, what-if analysis for proposed changes, and solution validation.

- **FR-010**: System MUST provide read-only analysis and suggestions; users must manually edit VRP JSON data based on chat recommendations (chat cannot modify data directly).

- **FR-011**: System MUST respond appropriately when asked questions before any VRP data is loaded.

- **FR-012**: System MUST handle questions about VRP features that don't exist in the current problem (e.g., asking about time windows when none are defined).

- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to reference specific elements in their VRP problem (e.g., "vehicle 2", "job at location X", "the morning time window").

- **FR-014**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the chat proactively alert users to potential issues in their VRP data, or only respond to explicit questions?]

- **FR-015**: System MUST provide expert-level responses assuming users have deep VRP domain knowledge, using technical terminology and advanced concepts without simplification.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Chat Session**: Represents an ongoing conversation about VRP analysis, maintains context of questions and answers, tied to current VRP problem state.

- **VRP Context**: The current VRP problem data (vehicles, jobs, locations, constraints) that provides context for chat responses.

- **Analysis Result**: Insights, explanations, or recommendations generated by the chat in response to user queries.

- **Chat Message**: Individual user question or system response within a session, includes timestamp and relation to VRP problem state.

## Notes for Planning Phase

### Clarifications Needed Before Planning
1. ~~**Integration Strategy**: Should ChatKit replace the existing VRP Assistant, complement it, or merge with it?~~ ‚úì **Resolved**: Replace entirely
2. ~~**Analysis Scope**: What level of VRP analysis is required (basic Q&A, comparisons, recommendations, debugging)?~~ ‚úì **Resolved**: Full analysis suite
3. ~~**Data Modification**: Should chat be read-only analysis or able to modify VRP data?~~ ‚úì **Resolved**: Read-only analysis
4. ~~**Session Persistence**: Should chat sessions persist across page reloads?~~ ‚úì **Resolved**: Browser session only
5. ~~**User Expertise Level**: Should explanations be beginner-friendly, expert-level, or adaptive?~~ ‚úì **Resolved**: Expert-level
6. **Proactive Alerts**: Should chat proactively identify VRP data issues or wait for questions?

### Dependencies Identified
- Existing VRP API Explorer with JSON editor and map visualization
- Current OpenAI integration and API key configuration
- VRP problem data structure and validation logic
- Solvice VRP API for solution generation

### Assumptions
- Users have expert-level understanding of VRP concepts, optimization theory, and constraint satisfaction
- Chat responses should leverage existing VRP solution data when available
- Natural language queries will focus on VRP-specific analysis rather than general conversation
- Chat interface should be easily accessible while viewing VRP problems and solutions
- Users are comfortable with technical terminology and advanced VRP concepts
