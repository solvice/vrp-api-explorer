- File-by-file refactoring checklist
- Effort estimates per task

**Best for:** Implementing specific refactorings, code reviews, pull request guidelines

---

## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Issues Found (Address First)

1. **openai-service.ts (783 LOC)** - 5 concerns mixed
   - Should be split into 4 focused services
   - Effort: 2-3 days
   - Impact: High (reduces core complexity)

2. **VrpJsonEditor.tsx (701 LOC)** - 6 concerns mixed
   - Should be split into 3 components + hooks
   - Effort: 1-2 days
   - Impact: High (improves maintainability)

3. **VrpAssistantContext.tsx (422 LOC)** - 22 methods, 4 concerns
   - Complex callback chains
   - Multiple sources of truth for VRP data
   - Effort: 2-3 days
   - Impact: High (clarifies state management)

### Code Duplication (Quick Wins)

1. **Mobile Detection Pattern** (3 locations)
   - Fix: Extract `useMobileDetection()` hook
   - Effort: 2-3 hours
   - Impact: High

2. **Keyboard Shortcut Handler** (2 locations)
   - Fix: Extract `useKeyboardShortcut()` hook
   - Effort: 2-3 hours
   - Impact: High

3. **Event Listener Pattern** (Multiple locations)
   - Already captured above

### Testing Gaps

| Service | LOC | Tests | Status |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|
| highlight-manager.ts | 466 | 0 | ❌ Missing |
| monaco-highlighter.ts | 398 | 0 | ❌ Missing |
| map-route-renderer.ts | 288 | 0 | ❌ Missing |
| map-marker-manager.ts | 246 | 0 | ❌ Missing |
| **Total Untested** | **1398** | **0** | **Critical** |

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days) - LOW RISK
- [ ] Extract `useMobileDetection()` hook
- [ ] Extract `useKeyboardShortcut()` hook
- [ ] Extract `useEditorHighlighting()` hook
- [ ] Add tests for visualization services

### Phase 2: Service Decomposition (4-6 days) - MEDIUM RISK
- [ ] Split `openai-service.ts` into 4 services
- [ ] Refactor `VrpJsonEditor` extract components
- [ ] Split `json-diff-service` concerns

### Phase 3: State Management (3-5 days) - HIGHER RISK
- [ ] Create solution data Context
- [ ] Refactor `VrpAssistantContext`
- [ ] Data synchronization service

### Phase 4: Component Simplification (3-4 days) - HIGHEST RISK
- [ ] Break down complex components
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Performance optimizations

**Total Estimated Effort:** 12-20 days

---

## Positive Patterns (Maintain These!)

✅ **Excellent Areas:**
- API error handling with typed errors
- Server-side API key security
- Three-layer input validation (sanitize → validate → complexity)
- TypeScript strict mode throughout
- Rate limiting implementation
- Custom hooks extraction (useVrpMessages, useMapStyle)
- Component composition patterns
- Feature flag infrastructure

These patterns show the team understands architectural best practices. Build on them!

## Questions or Clarifications?

This analysis is comprehensive but may have assumptions about:
- Team preferences (hooks vs classes, Redux vs Context)
- Performance requirements
- Timeline constraints
- Existing technical debt backlog

Review with your team and adjust recommendations as needed!
